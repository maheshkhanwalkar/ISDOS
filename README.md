# ISDOS
My First 16-bit OS, made back in '13

It is a OS that is 512 bytes (just a bootloader) that loads up and acts as a very
basic text editor (though it cannot save anything)

This GitHub repo is mainly used for archival purposes; however, feel free to browse through
the source and/or use it for your own purposes.

The ISDOS source code is licensed under the Apache v2 License. 

**Note:** The original source code was lost and the current result is reverse-engineered from old bootable
floppy image extracted from a floppy-boot emulation ISO.
